/**
 * The provider registry: one piece of data that both the server and the
 * settings UI read, so they can never disagree about what is supported.
 *
 * Everything downstream is derived from this array. `AgentProvider` is the
 * union of the ids below, the settings page renders the providers and their
 * models straight from it, and the server refuses any provider or model that
 * is not listed. Adding a provider means adding an entry here plus one branch
 * in `createProviderModel` in model.ts, not editing three places that drift.
 *
 * FREE TIER CLAIMS. Every `free: true` below was checked against the
 * provider's own published page on 2026-08-21 and the URL is recorded in
 * `freeTier.source`. These numbers move monthly. Re-read the sources before
 * trusting them: the labels here are a snapshot with a date on it, not a
 * promise, and the UI shows the date next to the claim for that reason.
