/**
 * Per IP rate limiting for the public agent route.
 *
 * /api/agent is unauthenticated and reachable by anyone with the URL. Whoever
 * pays for the tokens, that is a hole: a stranger can burn a server side key,
 * and even on a bring your own key deployment they can burn compute on a
 * function with a 300 second ceiling. So every caller is capped, including one
 * carrying their own key, because the cost being protected is not only tokens.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITATION. This counter lives in the process. Vercel runs several
 * instances and recycles them, so the real world cap is "N per instance per
 * window", not a global N. It raises the effort of draining the route by a lot
 * and it does not make it impossible. Doing this properly needs shared state
 * (Vercel KV, Upstash, Redis), and this app deliberately runs with no
 * datastore at all: the whole dataset is static files on IPFS. Adding a
 * database to hold rate counters would be the single biggest architectural
 * concession in the project, so the tradeoff is stated here rather than hidden
 * behind a claim of protection the code does not deliver.
